# zsaplink

There is no Blog associated with this repository. 
If the present is cloned with ABAPGIT, it makes available the SAPLINK program and the associated classes for plugins.
And this allows eventually to recover older abap projects expressed in linkees or nuggets.

To install ABAPGIT please refer to http://docs.abapgit.org/guide-install.html
